            <h2>What is BRFSS?</h2>
            <p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey conducted by the CDC in collaboration with U.S. states and territories. Since 1984, it has collected data on health behaviors, chronic conditions, and healthcare access from adults aged 18 and older.</p>

                <li><strong>Chronic Conditions:</strong> Hypertension, diabetes, long-term COVID effects</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive Measures:</strong> Immunizations, cancer screenings</li>

            <h2>How the Data Was Collected</h2>
            <p><strong>Sampling Method:</strong> The survey used both landline and cellular telephone sampling to reach a diverse adult population across all U.S. states and territories.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Interviews were conducted 7 days a week using Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) systems. Trained interviewers asked participants standardized questions about their health.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The CDC weighted responses to ensure the data accurately represents the U.S. adult population, accounting for demographic differences and sampling design.</p>
